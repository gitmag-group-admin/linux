## Linux history
This chapter briefly tells the history of Unix and where Linux fits in.

### 1969
All modern operating systems have their roots in 1969 when  Dennis Ritchie  and  Ken  Thompson  developed the C language and the  Unix  operating system at AT&T Bell Labs. They shared their source code (yes, there was open source back in the Seventies) with the rest of the world, including the hippies in Berkeley California. By 1975, when AT&T started selling Unix commercially, about half of the source code was written by others. The hippies were not happy that a commercial company sold software that they had written; the resulting  (legal) battle ended in there being two versions of  Unix: the official AT&T Unix, and the free  BSD  Unix.  

Development of BSD descendants like FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD and  PC-BSD is still active today.

### 1980
In the Eighties many companies started developing their own Unix: IBM created AIX, Sun SunOS (later Solaris), HP HP-UX and about a dozen other companies did the same. The result was a mess of Unix dialects and a dozen different ways to do the same thing. And here is the first real root of  Linux, when  Richard Stallman  aimed to end this era of Unix separation and everybody re-inventing the wheel by starting the  GNU  project (GNU is Not  Unix). His goal was to make an operating system that was freely available to everyone, and where everyone could work together (like in the Seventies). Many of the command line tools that you use today on  Linux  are GNU tools.

### 1990
The Nineties started with  Linus Torvalds, a Swedish speaking Finnish student, buying a 386 computer and writing a brand new POSIX compliant kernel. He put the source code online, thinking it would never support anything but 386 hardware. Many people embraced the combination of this kernel with the GNU tools, and the rest, as they say, is history.

### 2015
Today more than 97 percent of the world's supercomputers (including the complete top 10), more than 80 percent of all smartphones, many millions of desktop computers, around 70 percent of all web servers, a large chunk of tablet computers, and several appliances (dvd- players, washing machines, dsl modems, routers, self-driving cars, space station laptops...) run  Linux. Linux is by far the most commonly used operating system in the world.  
Linux kernel version 4.0 was released in April 2015. Its source code grew by several hundred thousand lines (compared to version 3.19 from February 2015) thanks to contributions of thousands of developers paid by hundreds of commercial companies including Red Hat, Intel, Samsung, Broadcom, Texas Instruments, IBM, Novell, Qualcomm, Nokia, Oracle, Google, AMD and even Microsoft (and many more).

## Linux distributions
This chapter gives a short overview of current Linux distributions.

### Red Hat
Red Hat is a billion dollar commercial Linux company that puts a lot of effort in developing Linux. They have hundreds of Linux specialists and are known for their excellent support. They give their products (Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora) away for free. While  Red Hat Enterprise Linux  (RHEL) is well tested before release and supported for up to seven years after release,  Fedora  is a distro with faster updates but without support.

### Ubuntu
Canonical started sending out free compact discs with  Ubuntu  Linux in 2004 and quickly became popular for home users (many switching from Microsoft Windows). Canonical wants Ubuntu to be an easy to use graphical Linux desktop without need to ever see a command line. Of course they also want to make a profit by selling support for Ubuntu.

### Debian
There is no company behind  Debian. Instead there are thousands of well organised developers that elect a  Debian Project Leader  every two years. Debian is seen as one of the most stable Linux distributions. It is also the basis of every release of Ubuntu. Debian comes in three versions: stable, testing and unstable. Every Debian release is named after a character in the movie Toy Story.

### Other
Distributions like CentOS, Oracle Enterprise Linux and Scientific Linux are based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and share many of the same principles, directories and system administration techniques.  Linux Mint, Edubuntu and many other *buntu named distributions are based on Ubuntu and thus share a lot with Debian. There are hundreds of other Linux distributions.

### Which to choose?
Below are some very personal opinions on some of the most popular Linux Distributions.
Keep in mind that any of the below Linux distributions can be a stable server and a nice  graphical desktop client.

| distribution name | reason(s) for using |
|--|--|
| Red Hat Enterprise (RHEL) | You are a manager and you want a good support contract. |
| CentOS | You want Red Hat without the support contract from Red Hat. |
| Fedora | You want Red Hat on your laptop/desktop. |
| Linux Mint | You want a personal graphical desktop to play movies, music and games. |
| Debian | My personal favorite for servers, laptops, and any other device. |
| Ubuntu | Very popular, based on Debian, not my favorite. |
| Kali | You want a pointy-clicky hacking interface. |
| others | Advanced users may prefer Arch, Gentoo, OpenSUSE, Scientific, ... |

## Linux installation
